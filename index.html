        <p>When we hear the word, most people associate it with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, it
            is much more than that! It is one of the most significant technologies which is developing secure trends
            in software development. Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized and secure nature, is disrupting
            various industries,
            including software development. Developers can leverage blockchain for creating decentralized applications
            (dApps), smart contracts, and secure data storage. </p>

        <p>The features of blockchain-oriented software systems like data replication, decentralized systems,
            public-key cryptography, and immutable transaction records are leading the technology adoption to
            its ever-growing popularity. Blockchain enhances transparency, security, and trust in software systems.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: #00468b underline 3px;">Quantum Computing</h2>
        <p> Quantum computers can solve complex problems exponentially faster than traditional computers, opening
            up possibilities for tackling optimization challenges, cryptography, and data analysis. Developers need
            to explore the potential of quantum algorithms and tools as this technology advances. It makes use of
            quantum phenomena like quantum entanglement and superposition principles to develop, study, monitor, and
            analyze the data, which can be tamed regardless of the source. </p>

        <p> For example, it was one of the main technologies in preventing the spread of coronavirus and developing
            potential vaccines for the pandemic. Quantum computing also has widespread applications in finance, fraud
            detection, and other such fields. Computers built using quantum computing technologies are called quantum
            computers, which are a multitude of times faster and more efficient when compared to our regular computers.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: #00468b underline 3px;">Low-code and No-code Development</h2>
        <p> Low-code and no-code platforms empower developers and non-technical users to build applications with
            minimal coding. These platforms provide visual interfaces, drag-and-drop functionality, and pre-built
            components, allowing for faster development and prototyping. They democratize software development and
            enable a broader range of individuals to create applications. </p> <br>

            <br>
        </center>

        <p> The complexity of developing the right code for different functionality is increasing day by day, and
            new talents are reluctant to work in such high-pressure environments. This is where low-code or no-code
            software development comes into play. Although the tools used for this trend do not necessarily replace
            the development of programs and code, it helps in bringing further benefits like:
        </p> <br>

        <ul class="list2">
            <li> Complementing software development pipelines</li>
            <li> lowering the barrier to entering the software field </li>
        </ul> <br>

        <p>In this method, developers create applications using visual interfaces with different drag-and-drop tools
            instead of writing code from scratch.</p>
